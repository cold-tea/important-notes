SPRING -->>
	Dependency Management
	Lightweight Nature
	Spring in Enterprise
		No need of heavy application servers
		Provides abstractions for enterprise systems
		We can focus on business logic rather than repetetive logic
	Open Source
	Unobtrusive
	
INVERSION OF CONTROL (DEPENDENCY INJECTION) -->>
	Container maintains class dependencies
	Object are injected at runtime, not compile time
	This prevents tight coupling between objects
	Reduces noise on the code
	
APPLICATION CONTEXT -->>
	Read only wrapper of the beans.
	Spring uses applicationContext to manage the beans
	Can have more than one application context running at the same time
	
JAVA BASED CONFIGURATION -->>
	Native language syntax
	Compile time checking of configuration
	Easier IDE integration
	Steps
		Annotate with @CONFIGURATION
		Create methods and annotate with @Bean
		If want to create constant beans then annotate with @Value
		
AUTOWIRING -->>
	Types
		Constructor
		Field
		Setter
	Constructor autowire should be preferred over field and setter
	
LIFECYCLE -->>
	Three phase:
		Initialization - 
			Spend most of the time in this phase
			Begins with the creation of application context
			Initialize bean factory
			Bean initialization and instantiation - 
				Using java config, xml config and (component scanning and autoconfiguration annotations)
				After the bean factory is initialized creating all the beans beanFactory post-processors starts working
					Most famous post-processor is PropertySourcesPlaceholderConfigurer -> this inject value reading the property file
				Bean instantiation is done in two ways
					Eager
						These beans are instantiated prior its usage.
						If the bean has other dependencies then it will be eager whether or not it is annotated with @Lazy
					Lazy
						It is loaded later when needed.
						If beans are dependent on the lazy bean then that lazy bean will be instantiated eagerly.
						Annotate such beans with @Lazy annotation
				After the bean is initialized setters are called
					Autowiring occurs (non-constructor autowiring) i.e, either through setter or fields. Field autowiring also uses setter autowiring behind the scene
				Bean post processing is the last phase of initialization
		Use
			
		Destruction - Spend very small time in this phase
		
		BeanPostProcessor Example - This is called before every init and after every destroy of bean postconstruct and predestroy.
			@Component
			public class CustomBeanPostProcessor implements BeanPostProcessor 
			{
				public Object postProcessBeforeInitialization(Object bean, String beanName) throws BeansException 
				{
					System.out.println("Called postProcessBeforeInitialization() for :" + beanName);
					return bean;
				}
				 
				public Object postProcessAfterInitialization(Object bean, String beanName) throws BeansException 
				{
					System.out.println("Called postProcessAfterInitialization() for :" + beanName);
					return bean;
				}
			}
			
			
ASPECTS -->>
	Reusable block of code injected into your application at runtime
	Powerful tools for adding behaviours
	Solve cross-cutting concerns
	Some example of places where aspects can be used
		Logging
		Transaction management
		Caching
		Security
	Works in the principle of DRY (Don't repeat yourself) i.e, it forbids code duplication
	Join Point -> is the point where execution of aspect is targeted toward. (eg. method, annotations etc for which the aspect is targeted towards)
	Pointcout -> is the expression which identifies for what join point is the aspect targeted towards
				Syntax - designator("r p.c.m(args))
							return type, package, class, method, arguments
							designator types ->
								execution, within, target, @annotation
	Advice -> code that is executed which is denoted by pointcut
	Aspect -> It is the module which contains all pointcuts, join points and advices
			
		
PROGRAM WHICH DEFINES EVERYTHING -->>
	CONFIGURATION CLASS 
		@Configuration
		@PropertySource(value = {"application.properties", "profiles-${spring.profiles.active}.properties"}) //profiles-{someText} is loaded according to the value provided in SPEL
																										// SPEL -> Spring Expression Language
		// @Import(value = AnotherSpringConfig.class)      // This will help autowire the bean from AnotherSpringConfig class to SpringConfig class
		@ComponentScan("com.sandesh.springlinkedin.component")  // This is an annotation based configuration used in spring
		public class SpringConfig {
			
			@Value(value = "${greeting.text}")
			public String greeting;
			
			// Priority is given more to the environment variables than that listed in property file
			@Value(value = "${JAVA_HOME}")
			public String javaHome;
			
			@Value(value = "${profiles.saysomething}")
			public String profile;
			
			// Injecting non string resources
		//	@Value("#{new Boolean(envirorment['spring.profiles.active']=='prod')}")  // Using environment variable   // This might not work whereas the below one works 
			@Value("#{new Boolean('${spring.profiles.active}'=='dev')}")  // Using property file    // This can also be used for reading from environment variables
			private boolean isDev;

			@Bean
			public String greeting() {
				return "Namaste " + greeting + ", " + javaHome;
			}
			
			// Reads spring.profiles.active property set in the env variables/property file and check whether the value is dev or prod and display result accordingly
			// In our case it is set in the property file named application.properties
			@Bean
			@Profile({"dev"})
			public InnerClass fromDev() {
				return new InnerClass("Development");
			}
			
			@Bean
			@Profile("prod")
			// @Prototype - not a shared instance like in singleton / @Session - used only in web, one instance per user session / @Request - used only in web, one instance per request
			public InnerClass fromProd() {
				return new InnerClass("Production");
			}
			
			@Bean
			public Student getStudent() {
				return new Student(200, "Mahesh");
			}
			
			
			public class InnerClass {
				private String value;
				public InnerClass(String value) {
					this.value = value;
				}
				public void print() {
					System.out.println("Hello " + value + ", Profile: " + profile + ", and boolean flag: " + isDev);
				}
			}
		}
