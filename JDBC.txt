JDBC -->>
	This allows to connect to the database.
	Provides a set of drivers and classes which makes it easier to connect to database.
	4 types of JDBC drivers
		JDBC-ODBC bridge driver - converts JDBC method calls into ODBC function calls
		Native-API driver - uses the client-side libraries of the database. converts JDBC method calls into native calls of the database API.
								Not written in JAVA
		Network Protocol driver - uses middleware (application server) that converts JDBC calls directly or indirectly into the vendor-specific database protocol. 
								It is fully written in java.
		Thin driver - thin driver converts JDBC calls directly into the vendor-specific database protocol. fully written in Java language.
		

CONNECTION -->>
	public class DbUtil {
	
		private final static String connectionString = "jdbc:h2:tcp://localhost/~/test";
		private final static String username = "sa";
		private final static String password = "";
		private static Connection connection = null;

		public static Connection getConnection() {
			
			try {
				Class.forName("org.h2.Driver");   
				connection =  DriverManager.getConnection(connectionString, username, password);
			} catch (SQLException e) {
				e.printStackTrace();
			} catch (ClassNotFoundException e) {
				e.printStackTrace();
			} finally {
				if (connection == null) {
					System.out.println("Cannot receive a valid connection...");
					System.exit(0);
				}
			}
			return connection;
		}
